If you don't feel comfortable reading personal expositions, turn back now, because Dr. Uday Kumar's lecture was particularly personal for me at this time in my life.  All my life, this wouldn't have been the case.  I was absolutely, positively dead set on my one and only goal: Getting into MIT.  I defined myself not in the context of a career, but in the context of my schooling.  I had interests, but they were secondary to going to MIT.  And this was ok with me: It was the way it was and always had been.  I didn't let it interfere with my education or curiosity.  To the contrary, I let it fuel my passion for exploring the intricacies of robotics, or the weird and quirky world of Quantum Physics, I let it push me into unknown territory of Computer Science and eventually I fell in love with the high level design process known as software Architecture, but through all of that my long term plans were to attend MIT.  And then, in my senior year, and then again the next year, and AGAIN the next year, when I was rejected from MIT 3 times, that identity was repeatedly shattered.  So strong was my commitment to the scholarly pursuit at this campus in Boston that It took three brutal knells to break my liberty bell.  And now, in the absence of some defining goal, I find myself rather adrift. I have interests, but no career goals, no long term plans for establishing myself beyond vague conceptuals and half-made promises to myself.  It's been quite the disorienting and scary experience.  Kumar's lecture, however, seemed to illustrate that this is how I'd always been, it was just hidden behind the larger pillar in the way.  Furthermore, not only was this how it had always been for me, this was how it *usually* is, an unfocused and hazy view of what you want to do with your future (a concept that *still* sounds foreign to me when I say it out loud) that takes fieldwork and experience to refine to a honed point.

Another point that I found interesting is his insistence on discarding great ideas that don't treat the core solution.  I found this to be particularly... backwards.  For me, innovation is a natural and organic process, one that resists taming and rigorous machining, and to discard the carefully tended fruits of that mental labor simply because they come at an innopportune moment seems not only careless and wasteful, but downright malicious.  Perhaps I'm overreacting, and the ideas aren't discarded but simply thrown back into a pile until they finish the current problem, upon which they're identified as
